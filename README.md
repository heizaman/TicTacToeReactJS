Tic Tac Toe game using ReactJS

This is an interactive tic-tac-toe game built with ReactJS. Try playing it (http://heizaman.github.io/play/tictactoe). You can also click on a button in the move list to go “back in time” and see what the board looked like just after that move was made. You can even resume playing the game from that move.

Bored? Play tic-tac-toe now and move back in history to learn where you went wrong
